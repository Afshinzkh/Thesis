#Calibrating Short-Rate Models Using Differential Evolution On A GPU

Description to be followed ...



future works to get a more precise result:
	- use pBest in the Mutation Part (Calibration of Interest Rate and Option Models
using Differential Evolution)
	- intepolate the data first and use more precise times (https://financetrainingcourse.com/education/2012/06/cox-ingersoll-ross-cir-interest-rate-model-parameter-calibration-short-rates-simulation-and-modeling-of-longer-term-interest-rates-an-example/)
